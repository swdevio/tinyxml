<h3 align=center>1.0</h3> <b> TinyXml </b>
<p>
TinyXml is a simple, small, C++ XML parser that can be easily integrating into other programs.
<p>
<b> What it does. </b>
<p>
In brief, TinyXml parses an XML document, and builds from that a Document Object Model that can be read, modified, and saved.
<p>
XML stands for "eXtensible Markup Language." It allows you to create your own document markups. Where HTML does a very good job of marking documents for browsers, XML allows you to define any kind of document markup, for example a document that describes a "to do" list for an organizer application. XML is a very structured and convenient format. All those random file formats created to store application data can all be replaced with XML. One parser for everything.
<p>
There are different ways to access and interact with XML data. TinyXml uses a Document Object Model, meaning the XML data is parsed into a tree objects that can be browsed and manipulated, and then written back to disk. You can also construct an XML document from scratch with C++ objects and write this to disk.
<p>
TinyXml is designed to be easy and fast. It is one header and two cpp files. Simply add these to your project and off you go. There is an example to get you started. It is released under the ZLib license, so you can use it in open source or commercial code.
<p>
It attempts to be a flexible parser, but with truly correct and compliant XML output. TinyXml should compile on any reasonably C++ system. It does not rely on exceptions or RTTI, and only uses the STL string class.
<p>
<b> What it doesn't do. </b>
<p>
It doesn’t parse or use DTDs (Document Type Definitions) or XSL’s (eXtensible Stylesheet Language.) It is limited to the ASCII character set. There are other parsers out there (check out www.sourceforge.org, search for XML) that are much more fully featured. But they are also much bigger, take longer to set up in your project, have a higher learning curve, and have a more restrictive license. If you are working with browsers or have more complete XML needs, TinyXml is not the parser for you.
<p>
<b> Code Status. </b>
<p>
Although currently in use, TinyXml is still in testing. Hopefully its structure and size are such that bugs that do occur will be easily fixed and wrapped back into the source. The code has not had time to mature.
<p>
It currently does not recognize "entity references", meaning special characters. This is a missing feature that will hopefully be included soon. Namely: <div class="fragment"><pre>
    &amp;amp;   &amp;
    &amp;lt;    &lt;
    &amp;gt;    &gt;
    &amp;quot;  "
    &amp;apos;  ‘
</div></pre>
<p>
<b> Using and Installing </b>
<p>
To Compile and Run xmltest:
<p>
A Visual C++ .dsp file is provided. Simply compile and run. It will write 3 xml files to disk. Hopefully the output matches the input! It also briefly demonstrates walking the DOM by printing out the top level element names.
<p>
A linux makefile is also provided. It is very generic and will probably run on other systems, but is only tested on linux.
<p>
To Use in an Application:
<p>
Add tinyxml.cpp, tinyxml.h, and tinyxmlparser.cpp to your project or make file. That's it! It should compile on any reasonably compliant C++ system. You do not need to enable exceptions or RTTI for TinyXml.
<p>
<b> Where it may go. </b>
<p>
It is my hope for this to become a collaborative effort. Tighten up the interface to the DOM, fix the entity references, and develop a stable useable XML parser.
<p>
In the future, I think it would be great if XSL and DTDs were added in some scalable way. So TinyXml would become a stand-alone core component of say MedXml (adding DTDs) and LargeXml( adding XSL.) :-) We’ll see.
<p>
<b> How TinyXml works. </b>
<p>
An example is probably the best way to go. Take: <div class="fragment"><pre>
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone=‘no’&gt;
    &lt;?-- Our to do list data --&gt;
    &lt;ToDo&gt;
        &lt;Item priority="1"&gt; Go to the &lt;bold&gt;Toy store!&lt;/bold&gt;&lt;/Item&gt;
        &lt;Item priority="2"&gt; Do bills&lt;/Item&gt;
    &lt;/ToDo&gt;
</div></pre>
<p>
It’s not much of a To Do list, but it will do. To read this file (say "demo.xml") you would create a document, and parse it in: <div class="fragment"><pre>
    TiXmlDocument doc( "demo.xml" );
    doc.LoadFile();
</div></pre>
<p>
And it’s ready to go. Now let’s look at some lines and how they relate to the DOM.
<p>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" standalone=‘no’&gt;
<p>
The first line is ignored by TinyXml, which only parses parts of XML 1.0 and only uses ASCII, so there’s not much point in worrying about parsing directives. But it does save the information, so the commands won’t be lost when it is saved back to disk. This line will be stored in a <a class="el" href="class_TiXmlUnknown.html">TiXmlUnknown</a> object.
<p>
&lt;?-- Our to do list data --&gt;
<p>
A comment. Will become a <a class="el" href="class_TiXmlComment.html">TiXmlComment</a> object.
<p>
&lt;ToDo&gt;
<p>
The ToDo tag defines a <a class="el" href="class_TiXmlElement.html">TiXmlElement</a> object. This one does not have any attributes, but will contain 2 other elements, both of which are items.
<p>
&lt;Item priority="1"&gt;
<p>
Creates another <a class="el" href="class_TiXmlElement.html">TiXmlElement</a> which is a child of the "ToDo" element. This element has 1 attribute, with the name ‘priority’ and the value ‘1’.
<p>
Go to the
<p>
A <a class="el" href="class_TiXmlText.html">TiXmlText</a>. This is a leaf node and cannot contain other nodes. It is a child of the ‘Item" Element.
<p>
&lt;bold&gt;
<p>
Another <a class="el" href="class_TiXmlElement.html">TiXmlElement</a>, this one a child of the "Item" element.
<p>
Etc.
<p>
Looking at the entire object tree, you end up with: <div class="fragment"><pre>
TiXmlDocument               "demo.xml"
    TiXmlUnknown            "?xml version="1.0" standalone=‘no’"
    TiXmlComment            " Our to do list data"
    TiXmlElement            "ToDo"
        TiXmlElement        "Item"      Attribtutes: priority = 1
            TiXmlText       "Go to the "
            TiXmlElement    "bold"
                TiXmlText   "Toy store!"
    TiXmlElement            "Item"      Attributes: priority=2
        TiXmlText           "bills"
</div></pre>
